Red velvet cake is traditionally a red, red-brown, crimson or scarlet-colored chocolate layer cake, layered with ermine icing. Traditional recipes do not use food coloring, with the red color due to non-Dutched, anthocyanin-rich cocoa. Common ingredients include buttermilk, butter, cocoa, vinegar, and flour.Red velvet is made with cocoa powder, vinegar and buttermilk. The chemical reaction between these ingredients help give the cake a deep maroon color that is often enhanced by extra food coloring.
